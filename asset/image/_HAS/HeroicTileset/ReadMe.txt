Dear you!

You're an very cool person and I appreciate you buying this thing wot I did! It's really very important to me.

My pack is a very simple, map set for a fantasy setting. The art style is semi-inspired by Heroies of Might and Magic 1. These tileset have been arranged in a 16x16 grid.

If you really like that tileset and you create a game, please mention me into the credits of your project. "Aleksandr Makarov" or "IKnowKingRabbit", whatever you feel like. :)
